In this project, we create a client application that will connect to the National Weather Service web site using HTTP and XML and/or SOAP and display current weather conditions. The client process connects to the server over a socket connection and request weather information for a certain location. The National Weather Service specifies the location using latitude and longitude instead of zip code. The user enters coordinates into the client program and get a current update for that location.
