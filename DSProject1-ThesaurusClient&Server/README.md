The objective of this project is to create a client/server system. 

The client process has a simple GUI interface which allows the user to select a word in a block of text and have the system send a query to a server to look up the word in a thesaurus file and return a list of alternative words from the server. The client process connects to the server and send the word that the user has selected in an input text box. The server returns a string that contains alternative words that the user might use instead of the input word. These alternative words will be separated by commas. For example, the string returned for the word “abandon” might look like this: “drops, dumps, ditches, discards, deserts, leaves, ends, gives up, looses, empties, vacates, resigns, quits”. Once the client has returned a result, it will allow the user to input another word to reference against the thesaurus.

The server reads the file "data.txt" to find the string of words related to the input word. It returns the associated string to the client process and keep the connection open. The client and server each has an Exit option that will close the program. The server process also has a GUI interface. It includes a text box which displays incoming client requests so as to verify that the processes are communicating.
